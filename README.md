# CasmataPro

A condensed version of [Cascadia Code PL](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) made to feel like [PragmataPro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/).

## The story

You know I'm a huge fan of `PragmataPro`. I have already tried to tune `Iosevka` to `PragmataPro`'s prefection. And you can observe the "wholesome attempt" in [Pragmasevka](https://github.com/shytikov/pragmasevka) font.

However it's not the end of a story! Browsing internet I have found this [blog post](https://horstmann.com/unblog/2010-11-22/fonts.html) from a fellow condensed fonts lover. With the simple script he turned out already great "DejaVu Sans Mono" font into absolutely amazing "DejaVu Sans Mono Condensed"!

So I started playing with the script by applying it to some of my vaforite fonts, that were too wide for me in everyday use. And honestly results weren't that great until I have stumbled upon `Cascadia Code`...

Regular `Cascadia Code` is not my cup of tea honestly because of the "fun" element added to it. But to be fair, exactly these irregularities and diviations from clear geometrical shapes hugely improve readability, and surprisingly statement still holds true when condensed.
